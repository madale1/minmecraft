minecraft edu Since late 2011, MinecraftEdu has made its way to thousands of classrooms around the world. It has been used to teach all kinds of skills and subjects from math to foreign languages to social justice to fair trade. Here you will find some resources and examples about using MinecraftEdu in your classroom.We know that sometimes performing tasks in Minecraft or MinecraftEdu can sometimes be complicated and daunting. So here you will find a series of step-by-step guides for doing common and some uncommon tasks with MinecraftEduMinecraftEdu is a school-ready remix of the original smash hit game Minecraft, played by over 60 million people worldwide. Created by teachers for classroom use and officially supported by Mojang, the company behind Minecraft, MinecraftEdu contains a set of powerful yet simple tools to fine-tune the Minecraft experience for learning. Teachers in over 40 countries use MinecraftEdu in every subject area from STEM to Language, to History, to Art. Many lessons and activities are made available for free, and there is a vibrant, active teacher community exploring uses of the game.MinecraftEdu is built on the same technology as the commercial edition of Minecraft and contains the same gameplay, items, and graphics included by Mojang. However MinecraftEdu is a separate edition of Minecraft that includes additional features that optimize the experience for classroom use. Like the commercial edition of Minecraft, MinecraftEdu includes client software that the individual players use as well as multi-player server software, but the MinecraftEdu client software will not work with a standard Minecraft server and vice versa.MinecraftEdu features:

What about Minecraft Pocket Edition

Minecraft: Pocket Edition (Minecraft: PE) is designed for use on tablets running iOS or Android operating systems. While Minecraft:PE is a great way to introduce younger students to Minecraft, it lacks many of the features that make it powerful enough to work with our tools. It also lacks the centralized control and moderation that makes the desktop version of Minecraft, and MinecraftEdu so suited for a classroom environment. Many intrepid tech savvy teachers have come up with some home grown work-arounds, but none of these are official and are completely unsupported by minecraft.
